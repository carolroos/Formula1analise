# Formula1analise

### The ideia is to analyse the data from all the years of Formula 1 and define the Champion of all times. Will be used a database from 1950 to 2022, but the scorting system will be from the year 2022, as listed below:

25 points;
18 points;
15 points;
12 points;
10 points;
8 points;
6 points;
4 points;
2 points;
1 point.

### OBS: Fastest lap extra point will not be used.
